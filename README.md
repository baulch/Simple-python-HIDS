###Host Intrusion Detection System###

This is a simple host intrusion detection to assist in understanding intrusion detection. It was created by myself as part of a module called 'Developing Quality Software and Systems II' at my university. It was developed along with an Implementation Tester and a Security Architect. (Not really, these was our roles in our Agile team environment, I was the programmer).

Feel free to use, however, line 15 is the only variable that needs to change in order for the program to work on separate systems.
